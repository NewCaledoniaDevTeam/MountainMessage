## Return of the Server Master

Within a couple of months, the server will be returned to Mountain Top. The server address will **NOT** change nor the port number. When doing so, the server is going to have a lot of changes. The map website will be updated, new logos added, and all the normal monthly updates like normal. Please make sure that all the images are in the logos to be added channel.

## New Currencies

With the new provinces, they decided to make their own currencies. Shrewsbuquerque created the Darzodian Credit, which is half the worth of a single credit. Eternalia created Drachmas, which is four times the original galactic credit. Both can convert into galactic credits via crafting tables. For more information please message the provinces.

## Food Addon

It is easier to add more than one addon at one time, rather than adding many addons in the future. With this in mind, Mountian Top decided to create the New Caledonia Food Addon. All the food suggestions are received from the citizens, so it's not just the council making all the decisions. Recommending items are free. You must understand that everything is not possible to the limitations of the bedrock edition. If you want to help with the food addon please join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/GMqpTajxYz) or download the latest beta version on the [GitHub](https://github.com/NewCaledoniaDevTeam/foodAddon/releases).

## Compressed Cobblestone

It has also come to Mountain Top's attention that civilians wanted the compressed cobblestone addon, we also plan to add that soon. This allows players to stack more cobblestone to create more effective mining trips. Also, it appears as darker cobblestone as a new building block to excite the average builder. It would also increase chest space since you would be able to compress the cobblestone and stack even more than usual. To learn more please visit the [mcpedl download page](https://mcpedl.com/compressed-cobblestone-addon-1/) or the [GitHub page](https://github.com/PiSaucer/CompressedCobblestone).

## Bank Of New Caledonia

BONC is receiving some final changes. Applications are now open at [Mountain Top Official Website](https://mountaintopofficial.ml/bonc/). Mountain Top also help create a competitor bot for Shrewsbuquerque's bank (own by TENET) called, the Provincial Bank of Bezos. BONC will only take galactic credits, while the Bank of Bezos will only take the Darzodian Credits. If they are given other currencies they would be converted to the proper one, free of charge. Both bots allow citizens to pay each other without logining into Minecraft, now users can pay anywhere at any time. It also documents transactions, so it reduces arguments. Sadly, this doesn't allow company owners to have two bank accounts, for business and others for personal matters. BONC also has zero account fees and zero interest fees. We plan to create a loan system in the future but it depends on the success of the BONC bot. It's understood that the Provincial Bank of Bezos has loans, however, they are not incorporated with the bot.

## Shrewsbuquerque

Mountain Top's CEO, Alan Saucer, is the original heretic of the darzos. Ironically, he is creating a similar mainframe bot for Shrewsbuquerque and their bank bot. As of this post, it has the same commands as the mainframe bot along with some new exclusive commands. You can check out some of the commands on the [Shrewsbuquerque's website](https://shrewsbuquerque.ml/cmd/). If you want to help test this bot please join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/ZSpmb7cs58). We are also planning to create another headquarters in Shrewsbuquerque.

## Final Announcements

Mountain Top officially announces their new official website at [mountaintopofficial.ml](https://mountaintopofficial.ml/). After school ends, we plan on doubling XP for a week. It was originally for the return of the councilman, Alan Saucer. We plan to start building a headquarters in two locations, one in twin peaks and the other in Shrewsbuquerque. If you have any questions from this article please let Mountain Top know, so they can fix it as soon as possible.

NOT DONE. 67
