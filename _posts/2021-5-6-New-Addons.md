New money for new food.

## Return of the Server Master

Within in new couple of months, the server will be returned to Mountain Top. The server address will **NOT** change nor the port number. When doing so, the server is going to have a lot of changes. The map website will be updated, new logos added, and all the normal monthly updates like normal. 

## New Currencies

With the new provinces, they decided to make there own currencies. Shrewsbuquerque created the Darzodian Credit, which is half the worth of a single credit. Eternalia created Drachmas, which are four times the original galactic credit. Both can convert into galactic credits via crafting tables. 

## Food Addon

It is easier to add more than one addon at one time, rather than adding many addons in the future. With this in mind, Mountian Top decieded to create the New Caledonia Food Addon. All the food suggestions are received from the citizens, so it's not just the council making all the decisions. Recommending items is free. You must understand that everything is not possible to the limitations of bedrock edition. If you want to help the food addon please join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/GMqpTajxYz) or download the lastest beta version on the [GitHub](https://github.com/NewCaledoniaDevTeam/foodAddon/releases).

## Compressed Cobblestone

It has also come to Mountain Top's attention that civilians wanted the compressed cobblestone addon, we also plan to add that soon. This allows players to stack more cobblestone to create more effective mining trips. Also, it appears as darker cobblestone as new building block to excite the average builder. It would also increase chest space since you would be able to compress the cobblestone and stack even more than usual. To learn more please visit the [mcpedl download page](https://mcpedl.com/compressed-cobblestone-addon-1/) or the [GitHub page](https://github.com/PiSaucer/CompressedCobblestone).

## Bank Of New Caledonia

BONC is receiving some final changes. Applications are now open at [Mountain Top Official Website](https://mountaintopofficial.ml/bonc/). Mountain Top also help create an competitor bot for Shrewsbuquerque's bank (own by TENET) called, the Provincial Bank of Bezos. BONC will only take galactic credits, while the Bank of Bezos will only take the Darzodian Credits. If they are given other currencies it would be converted to the proper one, free of charge. Both bots allow citizens to pay each other without logining to Minecraft, now users are able to pay anywhere at anytime. It also documents sells so it reduces arguments. Sadly, this doesn't allow company owners to have two bank accounts, for business and other for personal matters. BONC also have zero account fees and zero interest fees. We plan to create an loan system in the future but it depends on the success of the BONC bot. It's understood that the Provincial Bank of Bezos has loans, however, they are not incorporated with the bot.

## Shrewsbuquerque

Mountain Top's CEO, Alan Saucer, is the original heretic of the darzos. Ironicly he is create a similar mainframe bot for Shrewsbuquerque. As of this post, it has the same commands as the mainframe bot along with some new exclusive commands. You are able to check out some of the commands on the [Shrewsbuquerque's website](https://shrewsbuquerque.ml/cmd/). If you want to help test this bot please join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/ZSpmb7cs58).

## Final Announcements

Mountain Top offically annouces their new offical website at [mountaintopofficial.ml](https://mountaintopofficial.ml/). After school ends, we plan on doubling XP for week for the return of the councilman, Alan Saucer. We plan to start building an headquarters in two locations, one in twin peaks and other in Shrewsbuquerque.

NOT DONE.
