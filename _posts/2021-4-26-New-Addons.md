New money for new food.

Within in new couple of months, the server will be returned to Mountain Top. The server address will **NOT** change nor the port number. When doing so, the server is going to have a lot of changes. The map website will be updated, new logos added, and all the normal monthly updates like normal. 

With the new provinces, they decided to make there own currencies. Shrewsbuquerque created the Darzodian Credit, which is half the worth of a single credit. Eternalia created Drachmas, which are four times the original galactic credit. Both can convert into galactic credits via crafting table. 

NOT DONE.
