## The Plan

Businesses choose how many stocks they have and there pricing. The number of shares can only by an Admin, while the price of share (msrp) can be change by anyone with 30 percent of the company's shares. Please note that the percentage can change. The buyers and sellers agree there worth so they can sell below or above msrp. This can be done ingame, though BONC, or any other form of payment. The businesses monthly sales is split between the shares. The bot only record the msrp, amount of shares, and share trades (equivalent pay command with BONC or PBB).
